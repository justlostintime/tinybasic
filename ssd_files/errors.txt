      Other error message numbers may possibly occur if the
interpreter is malfunctioning.  If this happens, check the program in
memory, or reload it, and try again.

      Error number 184 may also occur if TINY BASIC is incorrectly
interfaced to the keyboard input routines.  A memory dump of the
input line buffer may disclose this kind of irregularity.
